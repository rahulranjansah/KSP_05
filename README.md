Here is a link on how to use GitHub for those who do not know : [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmK1Q5uzH4w&ab_channel=Meri%28Engel%29Kasprak-programmingvideos).

The problem statement is given in `Problem_Statement.ipynb` (which you can view directly in the browser). 

The data sets include 3 files - `galaxy.csv`, `gaia.csv` and `cepheids.csv`.
The description of each data set has been mentioned in the problem statement. 

## Instructions
* Note that you need to fill the form linked [here](https://forms.gle/2pG9bSkJZEHiRkhc8) and submit the link to this repo for applying. The deadline for that is 11:59 PM on 7th May 2024.
* To download the files, click on the green coloured code button and choose Download ZIP.
* Submit the solution code as a Python notebook `.ipynb`, along with a write-up describing your approach in the same python notebook. Name the file as `answers.ipynb` before submitting.
* To submit the file click on the Add file button at the top and Upload files.
* If you make any wrong uploads, just delete the file and re-upload. To delete a file, open the file, click on delete icon and commit changes.
* Please join this Telegram group for updates and doubt clarifications (if any) on the problem statement : [link](https://t.me/+BSoKKrZyYMI4NzFl).
* Weâ€™ll be manually grading the assignments so make sure you have written comments and explained the things you have done. We value professionalism in the submissions. The markdown feature in jupyter notebooks is your friend.
* The main aim behind this assignment is not to judge your coding skills but your ability to analyse the data and draw conclusions. Thus you should give enough attention to non-coding questions and the final conclusions that you draw from the data as well. 
* Use of internet is highly encouraged to familiarise yourself with the required astronomy knowledge.
